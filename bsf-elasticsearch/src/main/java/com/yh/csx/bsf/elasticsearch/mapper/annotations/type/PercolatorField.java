 * The percolator field type parses a json structure into a native query and stores that query,
 * so that the percolate query can use it to match provided documents.
 * <p>
 * Any field that contains a json object can be configured to be a percolator field.
 * The percolator field type has no settings. Just configuring the percolator field type is
 * sufficient to instruct Elasticsearch to treat a field as a query.
